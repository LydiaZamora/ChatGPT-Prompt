prompt:
Explain to me as if I were a student, What a class in JavaScript is

response:
Sure! Imagine you're building a house. You have a blueprint that tells you how to build the house, what materials to use, and what rooms it will have. In JavaScript, a class is like that blueprint.

Think of a class as a template or a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of those objects. Just like a blueprint for a house defines how the house will look and function, a class in JavaScript defines how objects created from it will behave and what they'll contain.

Let's break it down:

Properties: In a class, you define what properties your objects will have. These are like the characteristics of your house, such as the number of rooms, color of the walls, or type of roof. In JavaScript, these properties are variables that hold data.

Methods: Methods are like the actions your house can perform, such as opening doors, turning on lights, or playing music. In a class, you define what actions or functions your objects can perform. These functions are called methods in JavaScript.

Instances: Once you have the blueprint (class), you can create multiple objects based on that blueprint. Each of these objects is called an instance of the class. They all follow the structure and behavior defined in the class but can have different data.

Here's a simple example:

// Define a class named Car
class Car {
  // Properties
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
  
  // Method
  info() {
    return `${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}`;
  }
}

// Create instances of Car
let car1 = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2020);
let car2 = new Car('Tesla', 'Model S', 2022);

// Use methods
console.log(car1.info()); // Output: 2020 Toyota Camry
console.log(car2.info()); // Output: 2022 Tesla Model S

In this example, Car is a class that defines the structure of cars. It has properties like make, model, and year, and a method info() that returns information about the car. Then, we create two instances of the Car class (car1 and car2) with different data, and we can use the info() method to get information about each car.
